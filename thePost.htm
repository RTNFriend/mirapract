few threads back was an topic on making your own carrier phase GPS units. I do 
not survey for a living, but I use precision GPS units for timing purposes. 
Several of the units I have used have carrier phase capability. The units I have 
used that do offer carrier phase are discontinued Motorola Oncore VPs and 
Rockwell Jupiter OEM receiver boards.<BR><BR>To use the Motorola unit as an 
example. The OEM board is a 8 channel L1 unit. It cost about $270 when it was 
available (they are still available as used and refurb). They run off of 5 volt 
power, so if you want to use any other power, they need a voltage regulator 
circuit. I have designed my units to run off of 12 volts. The parts for a common 
7805T regulator should run under $5. They also need a signal level converter, so 
you computer can talk to it. The unit uses TTL and the computer requires RS232. 
You can use a common MAX232 chipset to do this and with required parts, it 
should be under $10. You will need a rugged metal case to withstand some abuse 
and to afford some RF shielding. Plan on $15 to $50 depending on the ruggedness 
you desire. You will also need some miscellaneous items, such as a power switch, 
an I/O connector, a couple of LEDs for power and 1PPS indicators. Say another 
$25. And a I/O cable that will supply power and a computer connection. Say $15. 
An antenna cable and a battery for the receiver.<BR><BR>Then if you plan to make 
measurements, you need a geodetic L1 antenna. $700 and up.<BR>You can build your 
own antenna and I have built 4 home made choke ring antennas, but I found that I 
could not get the antennas centered, so they were under 1 cm, when the 
measurements where taken against NGS benchmarks. And tripods cost and so 
on.<BR><BR>You will need a portable computer to log data with. You will need a 
software package that will post process the data. The only package I found for 
my receivers are GrafNet/GrafNav and the full blown package that will do float, 
static, and RTK is $5,000.<BR><BR>In my case, I need to know my position within 
16 cm. Positions outside of this box start to contribute to timing errors. The 
Oncores were fully capable of resolving under 2 cm lat/long and 5 cm vertical 
using the adjustment software and the equipment I had. We measured the new 
target base station antenna against three NGS benchmarks. Data was recorded for 
45 minutes the first time and three additional receivers were used with the 
timing base station. We waited a couple of days and a different time and 
recorded data again, but we went for 4 hours the second time. We recorded a 
third set of data for 4 hours. <BR><BR>The Oncore’s would probably do a lot 
better if I had geodetic antennas. The Motorola Oncore VP units when used for 
timing, provide a timing reference of 30 nanoseconds within UTC. I no longer use 
these units, they have been replaced by the Motorola Oncore M12+, a receiver 
than was optimized for precision timing. The end result in my case and 
application is I can provide a timing reference within 4 nanoseconds of UTC and 
this system is traceable back to NIST for frequency calibration.<BR><BR>In my 
case, I estimate that I spent close to $8,000 in the GPS system to get this 
capability. So throw in a little profit for the vendors and that will tell you 
were the cost is going. Throw in L2 capability, which you guys really need the 
most, etc, and there will be more cost. And remember, you get what you pay for 
in the long run with a good vendor.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

AM</FONT></I><BR><BR>After subtracting the $5000 for software(there's free L1 
software available and someone with GPS already has software that will work with 
Rinex) and about $670 for the antenna(good surveying grade antennas available 
for $30), then subtracting, say about $1500 for "profit", your down to about 
$850 for a "home brew" unit, and I think that price should actually be 
considerably lower.<BR><BR>I can also tell you that aside from the software, the 
circuit boards, in no way are "high ticket items". If you look at the 
manufacturers, you'll see these boards at pretty descent prices that are already 
setup for power in, antenna and data out. And the specs go with the times(the 
timing gets better and better), because no progressive company wants to continue 
manufacturing "old technology", even if the old technology would still 
suffice.<BR><BR>ASIDE FROM ALL THIS TALK ABOUT COST, I don't understand why more 
surveyors aren't "dreamers" or "techies" when it comes to GPS. <BR><BR>I would 
like to try some experiments . . . just to do it.<BR><BR><BR>

AM</FONT></I><BR><BR>As I have said before, I'm all for innovation. <BR><BR>I 
admire John Francis for his gumption and enthusiasm.<BR><BR>But if one of our 
competitors wants to devote time, energy, and money to "dream up" a home made 
set of receivers while I "dream up" new and profitable applications for clients 
using our store bought stuff, that's fine by me. Our store bought stuff was paid 
for a long time ago with a budget in place for maintenance, support and 
upgrades. <BR><BR>John is right, though. It helps to be a dreamer with technical 
skills. <BR><BR><FONT size=1><I>Modified By <B><A
